## About the MCC eCare Applications
The eCarePlan patient/caregiver- and clinician-facing applications were developed as part of a broader Electronic Care (eCare) Planning for People with Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC) project sponsored by the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/) (NIDDK) and the [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality](https://www.ahrq.gov/) (AHRQ). The project also received funding from the Office of the Secretary Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (OS-PCORTF). A multidisciplinary team led by EMI Advisors spearheaded the application development process.

This code was developed from 2021-2024 by [EMI Advisors](https://www.emiadvisors.net/) and is undergoing pilot testing with patients and caregivers through January 2025 at [Oregon Health and Sciences University](https://www.ohsu.edu/), led and evaluated by [RTI International](https://www.rti.org/).
